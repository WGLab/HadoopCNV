1. **How to report a bug or to ask a question?**

    The best way is: First, do read the website thoroughly especially FAQ. I received too many emails whose answers can easily be found in FAQ. Second, if you cannot find answer in FAQ or do not understand the answer well, then drop me an email  as which should contain (1) command line argument (2) error message in screen or the LOG file (3) sometimes example inputfile (4) in case you use Mac or Windows, let me know. The reason is that I can fix something or diagnose something only if I can understand the question and reproduce the results. So do yourself a favor and do me a favor, include details in your email to avoid wasting our mutual time sending multiple emails.
